    "> Changing 4 bytes of the original pdf file only affects the hash representation of the file, that will change dramatically. So, the number of bytes affected in the has is 32 bytes, since SHA256 produces a 256-bit output hash, regardless of the file size.\n",

    ">When comparing the velocity of attack for salted or unsalted hashes, we can see that unsalted hashes are much faster to attack because there's no need to account for the salt. We can just directly hash each password and compare it with the hash list. On the other side, salted hashes require brute-forcing the salt, which significantly increases the number of possibilities we need to check, the attack is slower.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Unsalted attack completes very quickly, as it's a direct comparison. Salted attacks, however, takes longer because we need to try all possible 256 salt values for each password. The total time complexity for salted hashes would be approximately 256 times slower than unsalted hashes due to the brute-force nature of the salt attack.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">In the code given the salt value is the same for all the passwords (os.urandom(1)), using the same value diminishes the benefit of salting because cracking the salt for one password, can be used to crack all the other, that explains how the salted hashes were cracked quickly, the process is almost as fast as cracking the unsalted hashes."

    "> The SHAttered attack utilizes a number of mathematical weaknesses in SHA-1′s compression function. This attack is based on chosen-prefix collision, an attacker can forge two files/messages with different content that leads to the same hash value. That is not the same as a random collision, this happens when you hash two different input randomly and after all it results in the one.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The process involves several steps:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Collision Generation: Attackers create two different documents by altering the content. In order to achieve this, one usually has to change the contents of a subset of bytes in input files while fitting them into place during for SHA-1 hash function allowing it return the same (original) result.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Differential Path: The SHA-1 method is built with the differential path, meaning if some modifications are certain not to affect your final hash output. To achieve this, one must be clear on the mathematical properties of SHA-1 and also understand how said hashing algorithm actually functions.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Finalization: Both papers get finalized to ensure that they still end up with the same SHA-1 hash and thus each meets all conditions of being a valid file in our example PDFs\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The SHAttered attack is significant because it exposes the flaws in SHA-1 and emphasizes the need for more robust hashing algorithms, like SHA-256 or SHA-3. The ability to hash two distinct files to the same value can have detrimental effects on certifications, digital signatures, and data integrity in general.\n",
