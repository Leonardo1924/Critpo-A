    "In the context of PKI\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Describe what is the accepted procedure of a client when receives a public-key certificate\n",
    "from a web server?\n",
    "\n",
    ">1. **Receive Certificate**: The client receives the public-key certificate from the web server during the SSL/TLS handshake.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">2. **Verify Certificate Chain**: The client verifies the certificate chain up to a trusted root certificate authority (CA). This involves checking each certificate in the chain to ensure it is signed by a trusted CA.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">3. **Check Validity Period**: The client checks the certificate's validity period to ensure it is currently valid (not expired or not yet valid).\n",
    ">\n",
    ">4. **Check Revocation Status**: The client checks if the certificate has been revoked. This can be done using Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) or the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP).\n",
    ">\n",
    ">5. **Verify Domain Name**: The client verifies that the domain name in the certificate matches the domain name of the web server.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">6. **Establish Secure Connection**: If all checks pass, the client establishes a secure connection with the web server using the public key in the certificate\n",
    ">\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Describe the process of certificate revocation and what are the possible reasons to apply\n",
    "it.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Process of Certificate Revocation**:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">1. **Revocation Request**: The certificate owner or the CA identifies the need to revoke a certificate.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">2. **Update CRL/OCSP**: The CA updates its Certificate Revocation List (CRL) or Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responder to include the revoked certificate.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">3. **Distribution**: The updated CRL is distributed to clients, or the OCSP responder is queried by clients to check the revocation status.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">4. **Client Check**: Clients check the CRL or query the OCSP responder during the certificate verification process to ensure the certificate has not been revoked.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">**Possible Reasons for Certificate Revocation**:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">1. **Compromise of Private Key**: If the private key associated with the certificate is compromised, the certificate must be revoked to prevent misuse.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">2. **CA Compromise**: If the CA that issued the certificate is compromised, all certificates issued by that CA may need to be revoked.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">3. **Change of Information**: If the information in the certificate (e.g., domain name, organization name) changes, the certificate may be revoked and reissued with the updated information.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">4. **Violation of CA Policy**: If the certificate owner violates the CA's policies or terms of service, the CA may revoke the certificate.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 5. **Certificate Expiry**: Although not a revocation reason per se, expired certificates are no longer valid and should not be used.\n",
