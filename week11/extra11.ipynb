    "## Q2: Shamir Secret Sharing\n",
    "\n",
    "In the extra work of class 1, we overviewed a technique for secret sharing that allowed messages to be split in parts, such that it could only be reconstructed if a subset of participants agreed to participate i.e. revealed their 'shares' of the original value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shamir Secret Sharing is based on polynomial interpolation over finite fields. Consider a point $(0 , 1)$. It is easy to observe that there is an overwhelming number of polynomials p of degree 1 such that $p (0) = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "$p ( x ) = x +1; p ( x ) = 2 x +1; p ( x ) = 4 x +1; etc.$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when given two points $(0 , 1)$ and $(1 , 3)$ there is only one polynomial p for which these points are valid: $p ( x ) = 2 x +1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition for Shamir Secret Sharing is that secrets are represented as polynomials, and shares are represented as points in said polynomial. As such, one can very flexibly select the number of necessary shares and the threshold for secret reconstruction by adjusting the parameters of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will consider integer polynomial coefficients, and standard integer arithmetic. A practical implementation of shamir secret sharing requires computation over a finite field to ensure privacy. However, for this didatic exercise, we can disregard this very simple adaptation , as the intuitions we want to understand can be observed in integer arithmetic, which is slightly more straightfoward to explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question - P1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the secret sharing function that takes value $x$ and produces a set of four shares $x_1$ , $x_2$ , $x_3$ , $x_4$ such that any three can be used to reconstruct the original value.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will entail responding to the following problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1- What degree should the polynomial be, so that three points are sufficient to reconstruct the value, but two points can never be enough?\n",
    "- 2- How can we generate a polynomial f of that degree, such that f (0) = x ?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question - P2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement a function for polynomial interpolation, that takes $n$ points, and recovers the only polynomial of degree $n-1$ that contains those points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Show how this allows for the secret to be recovered:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1- Generate a polynomial f for secret number 1001 and shares (points) for that secret.\n",
    "- 2- Take only the minimum amount of necessary shares (randomly selected) and retrieve the polynomial f '\n",
    "- 3- Show that, for $x = 0$, $f ' ( x ) = 1001$, and thus the secret can be recovered.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question - P3:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use what you implemented to test the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1- Generate a polynomial f for secret number 100 and shares (points) for that secret: $x_1$ , $x_2$ , $x_3$ , $x_4$ .\n",
    "- 2- Generate another polynomial g for secret number 550 and shares (points) for that secret $y_1$ , $y_2$ , $y_3$ , $y_4$.\n",
    "- 3- Calculate $z_1 = x_1 + y_1$ ; $z_2 = x_2 + y_2$ and $z_3 = x_3 + y_3$\n",
    "- 4- Use your secret recovery method using points $z_1$ , $z_2$ , $z_3$ . What can you conclude from the result? Justify what happened."

    "#### 1 - What degree should the polynomial be?\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that any three points are sufficient to reconstruct the value, but two points can never be enough, we need the degree of the polynomial $f(x)$ must be 2. This is because:\n",
    "    - A polynomial of degree d is uniquely determined by d+1 points.\n",

    "When we combine the shares of two secrets and recover the secret from the combined shares, the result should be the sum of the two original secrets. This is because the addition of the shares corresponds to the addition of the polynomials, and evaluating the combined polynomial at \\( x = 0 \\) will give the sum of the original secrets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the recovered secret should be \\( 100 + 550 = 650 \\). This demonstrates that the secret sharing scheme is linear, meaning that the sum of the shares corresponds to the sum of the secrets."
